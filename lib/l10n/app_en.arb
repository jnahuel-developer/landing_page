  "aboutDescription": "I am an Electronic Engineer with more than seven years of experience in software, firmware, and application development, with a background in highly demanding sectors such as the medical and financial industries. My technical training, combined with hands-on experience in regulated environments, allows me to approach complex projects with a comprehensive vision: from initial conception to final implementation, ensuring quality, efficiency, and regulatory compliance.\n\nThroughout my career I have been involved in high-impact projects, including the creation and commercialization of certified medical devices and the development of critical software solutions for financial systems. These projects required not only a strong command of programming languages such as C, C++, and C#, but also the ability to manage quality under international standards such as ISO 13485. Thanks to these experiences, I have achieved measurable results such as reducing production costs, optimizing quality control processes, and implementing robust and secure solutions in production environments.\n\nIn my current role as a freelance developer, I specialize in designing and building cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter, with integrations in Firebase, external APIs, and cloud services. My goal is to deliver scalable, secure, and user-oriented applications that provide real value to organizations. The industry experience I have gained enables me to translate business needs into viable technological solutions, balancing innovation, quality, and efficiency.",
